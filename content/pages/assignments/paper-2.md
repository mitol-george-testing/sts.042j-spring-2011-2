_Instructions for Paper 2_

Assignment
----------

A paper on **one** of the following topics.

Due Date
--------

Ses #13

Length
------

6â€“7 double-spaced pages. You should use standard margins (1-inch to 1.25-inches on each side of the page) and a 12-point font.

Grade
-----

Your grade on _Paper 2_ will contribute 30% of your final course grade.

**_Option A_: General relativity and the ivory tower**

**_Option B_: Institutions and the quantum revolution**

While preparing your essay, you should consider _at least three_ of the readings. Use them as resources to help you articulate and defend a specific argument. The goal of the assignment is _not_ to summarize the readings or merely paraphrase the authors' arguments, but rather to state your own position and defend it using examples and evidence from these readings.

When drawing on readings, use standard footnote conventions and include a bibliography of sources cited at the end.
