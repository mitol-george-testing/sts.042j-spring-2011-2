Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Subject Description
-------------------

This course explores the changing roles of physics and physicists during the 20th century. Ranges from relativity theory and quantum mechanics to high-energy physics and cosmology. Examines the development of modern physics within shifting institutional, cultural, and political contexts, such as physics in Imperial Britain, Nazi Germany, US efforts during World War II, and physicists' roles during the cold war.

Subject Requirements
--------------------

This is a Communications Intensive (CI-M) subject for physics majors. As a CI subject, there will be a heavy emphasis upon writing and oral communication. There will be three papers assigned for a total of 20-24 pages of writing over the course of the semester. Students will revise and resubmit their second papers, to give them an opportunity to work on specific writing skills before preparing the final paper. Details of the paper assignments will be circulated in class.
